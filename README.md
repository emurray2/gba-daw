A small Digital Audio Workstation for the Gameboy Advance

# Features
- Metronome with BPM
- Tone-row generator

# Source code explained:
`metronome.cpp` includes code I made for the Gameboy Advance which was originally a metronome. The code currently uses this metronome functionality to play through musical sequences, such as a generated [tone-row matrix](https://musictheory.pugetsound.edu/mt21c/section-194.html). The tone-row matrix can be generated using any given input string ("Hello, world!" in this case).
